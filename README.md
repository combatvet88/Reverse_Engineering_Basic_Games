# Reverse_Engineering_Basic_Games

If you have trouble loading the game (typing in the special characters). Use the shift key plus the c key to type the first letter and then type ATACOMBS.

LOAD "(shift c)ATACOMBS",8,1

The raster.d64 - contains the version for the code I modified. The ahoy1987-01.d64 is the original game (not changed).

Ask if you have any questions. :)
